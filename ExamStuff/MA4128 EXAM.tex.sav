\section*{Attempt All Questions}

\subsection*{Question 1 : Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Principal Component Analysis is a data reduction technique. Explain what this term means.
\item The KMO is used to measure what characteristic of the data. Explain how the KMO measure should be interpreted.
\item Briefly describe the Bartlett Test for Sphericity, with reference to the null and alternative hypotheses, and how those statements relate to the purpose of the test.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 2 : Cluster Analysis}


\begin{itemize}
\item Compare and constrast agglomerative and divisive clustering.
\item Explain the difference between Wardâ€™s method and k means
 clustering.
\item Vertical Icicle Plot
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the context of hierarchical cluster analyses, distinguish between agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering.
\item What is a vertical icicle plot used for? Give a brief dscription, supporting your answer with sketches.
\item Compute the Euclidean distance between the following points.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 3 :k-means cluster analysis}
Use two clusters.
Illustrate your answer with sketches.

\subsection*{Question 4 : Model Selection}

\begin{itemize}
\item Overfitting
\item Multi-collinearity
\item Law of Parsimony
\end{itemize}


%http://www.education.umd.edu/EDMS/student/Exams/PrelimCompSpr09.pdf
Answer the following questions related to multicollinearity in the context of multiple
regression analysis.
\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] Define multicollinearity.
\item[b.] State two ways in which a multiple regression analysis could be affected by severe
multicollinearity.
\item[c.] State two ways of formally diagnosing the severity of multicollinearity. Include any
relevant formula(s) and define each formulaic component. What benchmark criteria are
typically used in practice to make decisions about the severity of the impact for each of
the diagnostic methods?
\item[d.] Describe two statistical methods that can be applied to the data to lessen the effects of
severe multicollinearity. 
\end{itemize}





Compare and contrast the following variable selection procedures
\begin{itemize}
\item Forward Selection
\item Backward Elimination
\item Stepwise Selection
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection*{Question 5 : Discriminant Analysis}
Compare and contrast MANOVA


\subsection*{Question 6 : Model Validation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Training Data
\item Validation Data
\item Testing Data
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Question 7 : Missing Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is Missing Data? Discuss the implications of Missing Data in the context of a statistical analysis.
\item What is Multiple Imputation
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare and contrast the following types of missing data: Missing At Random, Missing Not At Random, Missing Completely at Random.
\item Briefly describe the technique of Imputation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 8 : Logistic Regression}
Under what circumstances would you choose to use logistic regression?

%http://www.public.iastate.edu/~stat415/stephenson/exam-sol.pdf
Given the equation
\bigskip

The usual assumptions placed on the error terms in ordinary least squares
regression are:
\begin{itemize}
\item independently distributed
\item identically distributed (equal variance)
\item normally distributed
\end{itemize}
Which of these assumptions are violated when dealing with binary response data? Explain briefly how each is violated.
\\
What is a logit? How can you transform a logit into a probability?
\\
What is the only real limitation with logistic regression?  How does probit analysis differ from logistic regression?
\\
