The logit, or logistic regression model, is a form of regression analysis that takes data and tries to predict outcomes with it, such as basing a customer's propensity towards purchasing a new car or not on his or her income, age, and family size. The probit model is also a form of linear regression with a simpler binary component to it that tries to predict the maximum likelihood of one of two outcomes, such as whether an individual is married or not based on available probit regression data.
