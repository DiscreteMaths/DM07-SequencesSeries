\section{Series}



\begin{itemize}
\item A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. 
\[ S_n = u_1 + u_2 + u_3+ \ldots +u_n\]
\item A series is usuall expressed in terms pf \textbf{sigma notation}.
\item It is useful to remember the following, particularl in the context of proof by induction.
\[S_1 = u_1\]
\[S_{n+1} = S_n + u_{n+1}\]

\end{itemize}
