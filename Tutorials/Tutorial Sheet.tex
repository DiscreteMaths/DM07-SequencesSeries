Explain how the Akaike Information Criterion would be used in the context of model selection.




Under what sort of modelling problem would you use Binary Logistic Regression?

Discuss some of the traditional technique for dealing with Missing Data, making references to the limitations of each.



\section*{Missing Data}

\begin{itemize}
\item[5.a] Describe three types of missing data.
\item[5.b] what is meant by multiple imputation?
\item[5.c] Compare and contrast the following types of missing data: Missing At Random, Missing
Not At Random, Missing Completely at Random.
\item[5.d]Briefly describe the technique of Multiple Imputation.
\item[5.e] Discuss some of the traditional techniques for dealing with Missing Data. For each technique discuss the limitations of that technique.
\item[5.f] What is meant by missing data? Discuss the implications of Missing data in the context of a statistical analysis.
\end{itemize}



\section*{MANOVA and Discriminant Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item[6.a] The MANOVA procedure is sensitive to Multivariate Outliers. What is a multivariate outlier? Describe a method for detecting multivariate outliers.

\item[6.b] Pillai's Trace and Wilk's Lambda are two test procedures used in MANOVA, each fulfiling the same purpose.
Describe the purpose of these tests.

\item[6.c] What is the purpose of a discriminant analysis? How does discriminant analysis differ from MANOVA?

\item[6.d] Explain the following terms: confusion matrix, prior probabilities cost of misclassification, and apparent error rate.

\item[6.e] Distinguish between the True Error Rate and the Apparent Error Rate

\item[6.f]  What is the confusion matrix? Explain how it is interpreted.

\item[6.g] Explain why multinomial logistic regression may be used in preference to Discriminant Analysis.

\item[6.h] The apparent error rate calculated when all observations are used to construct
the discriminant rules is known to underestimate the true error rate. What can be done
to overcome this problem?

\item[6.i] Compare and contrast univariate and bivariate outliers. Describe how Mahalanobis Distance is used to detect bivariate outliers. Support your answer with an illustration.

\end{itemize}
