\begin{itemize}
\item[2.a] What is the difference between agglomerative and divisive clustering?
\item[2.b] What is the difference between hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering?
\item[2.c] How do we determine the appropriate number of clusters?  Give two different visualization methods that are used to display the outcome of a cluster analysis.

\item In the context of hierarchical cluster analyses, distinguish between agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering.
\item What is a vertical icicle plot used for? Give a brief dscription, supporting your answer
with sketches.

\item Explain why squared Euclidean Distance may be used in preference to Euclidean Distance.
\item Compute the squared Euclidean distance and the Manhattan (a.k.a. city block) distance between the following points A and B.
\[ \mbox{A} =\{2,5,1,7\}  \]
\[ \mbox{B} =\{1,6,3,6\}  \]
