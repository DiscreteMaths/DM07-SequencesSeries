\subsection{Binary Classification}

Binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups on the basis of a Classification rule. Some typical binary classification tasks are

\begin{itemize}
\item medical testing to determine if a patient has certain disease or not (the classification property is the presence of the disease)
\item quality control in factories; i.e. deciding if a new product is good enough to be sold, or if it should be discarded (the classification property is being good enough)
\item deciding whether a page or an article should be in the result set of a search or not (the classification property is the relevance of the article, or the usefulness to the user)
\end{itemize}
Statistical classification in general is one of the problems studied in computer science, in order to automatically learn classification systems; some methods suitable for learning binary classifiers include the decision trees, Bayesian networks, support vector machines, neural networks, probit regression, and logit regression.

Sometimes, classification tasks are trivial. Given 100 balls, some of them red and some blue, a human with normal color vision can easily separate them into red ones and blue ones. However, some tasks, like those in practical medicine, and those interesting from the computer science point of view, are far from trivial, and may produce faulty results if executed imprecisely.
