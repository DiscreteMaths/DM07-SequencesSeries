\subsection{Types of multicollinearity}

There are two types of multicollinearity: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Structural multicollinearity
\item Data-based multicollinearity
\end{itemize}
Structural multicollinearity is a mathematical artifact caused by creating new predictors from other predictors — such as, creating the predictor x2 from the predictor x. 
Data-based multicollinearity, on the other hand, is a result of a poorly designed experiment, reliance on purely observational data, or the inability to manipulate the system on which the data are collected. 
In the case of structural multicollinearity, the multicollinearity is induced by what you have done. Data-based multicollinearity is the more troublesome of the two types of multicollinearity. Unfortunately it is the type we encounter most often!

\subsection{Variance Inflation Factor}

We learned previously that the standard errors, and hence the variances, of 
the estimated coefficients are inflated when multicollinearity exists. 
So, the variance inflation factor for the estimated coefficient $b_k$, denoted $VIF_k$, 
is just the factor by which the variance is inflated. 

Variance inflation factors k greater than 4 suggest that the multicollinearity should be investigated. 
Variance inflation factors greater than 10 are taken as an indication that the multicollinearity may be unduly influencing the least squares estimates.

\subsection{Tolerance}
A tolerance close to 1 means there is little multicollinearity, whereas a value close to 0 suggests that multicollinearity may be a threat. The reciprocal of the tolerance is known as the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). The VIF shows us how much the variance of the coefficient estimate is being inflated by multicollinearity. For example, if the VIF for a variable were 9, its standard error would be three times as large as it would be if its VIF was 1. In such a case, the coefficient would have to be 3 times as large to be statistically significant.

\[ \mbox{Tolerance} = \frac{1}{VIF}\]
