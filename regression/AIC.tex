We define two types of information criterion: the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). In AIC and BIC, we choose the model that
has the minimum value of:
\[AIC = −2log(L)+2m,\]
\[BIC = −2log(L)+mlogn\]

where
\begin{itemize}
\item L is the likelihood of the data with a certain model,
\item n is the number of observations and
\item m is the number of parameters in the model.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{AIC}
The Akaike information criterion is a measure of the relative \textbf{goodness of fit} of a statistical model.

When using the AIC for selecting the parametric model class, choose
the model for which the AIC value is lowest.
